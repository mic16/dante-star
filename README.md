# dante-star
A random maze generator and solver for linux

How to use the program:

1. type make in a terminal in the repository
2. type ./generator/generator "x size" "y size" > "file name" (the "> "file name"" allows the program to store it's outcome in a file which will be used in the next step. The file name can be what ever you desire)
3. type ./solver/solver "file name" | grep o (the "| grep o" allows the path to be more visual as it is in red instead of white like the rest of the maze"
4. Enjoy!
